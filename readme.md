# Using the Laravel Docker Image for Your Laravel Application

This guide explains how to use the **`gkibria121/laravel`** Docker image to run your Laravel application in a containerized environment.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your system.
- A Laravel application ready to be run.

## Steps

### 1. Clone Your Laravel Project

If you don't have a Laravel project, create one or clone an existing Laravel repository. For example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-laravel-project.git
cd your-laravel-project
```
````

### 2. Create a `docker-compose.yml` File

In the root of your Laravel project, create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following configuration:

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  app:
    image: gkibria121/laravel # The Docker image to use
    volumes:
      - .:/app # Mounts the current directory to /app inside the container
    ports:
      - "8000:8000" # Maps port 8000 of the container to port 8000 on the host machine
    command: php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000 # Start Laravel's built-in server
```

### 3. Build and Run the Docker Containers

Use the following command to build and run the containers:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will:

- Build the Docker image if it's not already available locally.
- Run the Laravel application inside the container and expose it on port `8000`.

### 4. Access the Application

Once the Docker container is running, open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

You should now see your Laravel application running inside the Docker container.

### 5. Stopping the Containers

To stop the containers, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This will stop and remove the containers but retain the images and volumes for future use.

## Additional Information

### Customizing the Docker Image

If you want to make any changes to the Docker image, you can create a `Dockerfile` and modify the `docker-compose.yml` to build the image from the `Dockerfile`.

For example, add a `Dockerfile` in the root of your project:

```Dockerfile
FROM php:8.2-cli

# Install required extensions
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y libzip-dev unzip \
    && docker-php-ext-install pdo pdo_mysql

# Copy the Laravel app into the container
COPY . /app

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Expose port 8000
EXPOSE 8000

# Run the Laravel server
CMD php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000
```

Then update your `docker-compose.yml` to build the image:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    build: . # Build from the Dockerfile in the current directory
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    command: php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000
```

Now when you run `docker-compose up --build`, it will build the image from your `Dockerfile`.

## Conclusion

You now have a working Docker environment for your Laravel application. This allows you to containerize your Laravel project and access it through your browser with minimal configuration.
